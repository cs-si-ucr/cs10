# CS10
Site for CS10

The handouts are written in markdown and the static
site is generated by a Python program called MkDocs.

The YAML configuration file (`mkdocs.yml`) describes the 
structure of the generated site and mkdocs uses the 
markdown files in the `docs` folder as a source of the 
site content.

Go to the [MkDocs documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/) for mkdoc install instructions.
